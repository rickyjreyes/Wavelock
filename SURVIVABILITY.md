# 🛡️ WaveLock Survivability Specification (Tier-0)

> **Document:** SURVIVABILITY.md  
> **Applies To:** WLv2 Commitments & Signature Layer  
> **Status:** Draft (Pending WLv3 Hash-Agnostic Framework)  
> **Purpose:** Define how WaveLock remains safe, verifiable, and functional  
> **even if modern cryptography collapses.**

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the **survivability guarantees** of the WaveLock Tier-0 architecture.  
It describes the mechanisms that ensure WaveLock remains:

- secure  
- verifiable  
- irreversible  
- globally interoperable  
- bounded in curvature  
- resistant to cryptographic failure  

under all foreseeable conditions, including:

- hash function failures  
- signature scheme deprecations  
- quantum adversaries  
- model-generated forgeries  
- hardware drift  
- network-level corruption  

Survivability is defined as:

> **“The continued correctness of the WaveLock state-evolution and identity system,  
> independent of specific cryptographic primitives.”**

---

# 2. Tier-0 Foundations (What Cannot Break)

Tier-0 does **not** depend on cryptographic hardness.

Its core guarantees are:

### ✔ 2.1 Empirical Physical Irreversibility  
The PDE-based evolution `ψ₀ → ψ★` is contractive and dissipative. Under all tested
adversaries (adjoint PDE, gradient optimization, neural inversion, Fourier deconvolution),
the forward map has not been inverted. This provides a **physics-anchored identity** for
any agent. Note: this is an empirical observation, not a formal proof of irreversibility.

### ✔ 2.2 Curvature-Budget Enforcement  
WaveLock enforces global curvature ceilings:

- `E_grad`
- `E_fb`
- `E_ent`
- `E_tot`

ensuring:

- bounded reasoning trajectories  
- Lyapunov stability  
- no chaotic or runaway evolution  

### ✔ 2.3 Deterministic Reproducibility  
WLv2 commitments serialize:

- schema  
- kernel metadata  
- ψ★  
- curvature invariants  

into a canonical, deterministic byte sequence.

This allows any node to independently recompute and verify state validity.

These three properties **cannot be invalidated by cryptographic deterioration**.

---

# 3. Failure Model (What Must Be Survived)

WaveLock Tier-0 must survive:

### 🟥 3.1 Hash Function Breaks  
- SHA-256 collision attack  
- SHA-256 preimage attack  
- SHA-256 structure exploitation  
- SHA-2 family deprecation  

### 🟥 3.2 Signature Scheme Breaks  
- ECDSA / EdDSA deprecation  
- PQ cryptanalysis (lattice breaks)  
- quantum-accelerated key recovery  

### 🟥 3.3 Adversarial AI Attacks  
- model-generated forged commitments  
- surrogate ψ★ reconstructions  
- false-positive curvature states  
- low-entropy signature impersonation  

### 🟥 3.4 Distributed Drift  
- cross-hardware nondeterminism  
- GPU kernel version mismatch  
- floating point divergence  

Tier-0 must continue functioning correctly with **no trust assumptions**.

---

# 4. Survivability Mechanisms (Tier-0)

Survivability arises from four independent mechanisms:

## ✔ 4.1 Physics-Grounded Identity (ψ★)
Identity =  
> **“The agent capable of evolving ψ₀ to ψ★ under a specific kernel version.”**

Cryptographic identity is **binding**, not foundational.

ψ★ remains valid even if all signatures fail.

---

## ✔ 4.2 Kernel-Locked Evolution  
Each WLv2 state contains:

- kernel version  
- kernel hash  
- PDE parameters  
- numerical safety bounds  

A node will reject:

- mismatched kernels  
- tampered evolution histories  
- altered curvature metrics  

This prevents adversarial rule changes.

---

## ✔ 4.3 Curvature-Invariant Revalidation  
Any verifier can:

1. Load ψ★  
2. Recompute curvature metrics (E_grad, E_tot, …)  
3. Reject if outside allowed bounds  

This guarantees the state is:

- physically realizable  
- safe  
- bounded  
- consistent with WaveLock laws  

This is independent of digital signatures.

---

## ✔ 4.4 Upgradeable Cryptographic Bindings  
WaveLock treats hashing and signing as *replaceable modules*:

- old commitments can be re-anchored under new hash families  
- doubly-hashed (dual-hash) signatures prevent catastrophic failure  
- schema evolves without altering ψ★ identity  

Cryptography becomes **versioned plumbing**,  
not the foundation of the system.

---

# 5. Required Components (Current Gaps)

Tier-0 is **physics-complete** but **cryptography-incomplete**.

The following components must be added:

### 🔧 5.1 `HASH_FAMILY` Enum  
A registry of:

- SHA-256  
- SHA3-256  
- (future hashes)  

### 🔧 5.2 `hash_config` Router  
Central module determining:

- which hash is used for commitments  
- how dual-hash binding is computed  
- epoch-based upgrades  

### 🔧 5.3 Dual-Hash WLv3 Commitment  
Binding structure:
- C1 = HASH_A(WLv2_bytes)
- C2 = HASH_B(WLv2_bytes)
- commitment = C1 || C2


### 🔧 5.4 SIG-WCT (Canonical Signature)  
Signature binds:

- ψ★  
- dual-hash commitment  
- schema metadata  
- message  
- kernel version  

### 🔧 5.5 `docs/SURVIVABILITY.md` (this file)  
Detailed pathway for cryptographic migration.

These upgrades are **guaranteed forward-compatible**  
because ψ★ identity does not change.

# 6. Cryptographic Failure Scenarios

This section explains how WaveLock responds to failure events.

---

## 🟥 Scenario A: SHA-256 Collisions Discovered

**Effect:**  
SHA-256 commitments can be forged.

**Response:**  
- Switch to `HASH_A = SHA3-256`  
- Assign `HASH_B = BLAKE3` (or future hash)  
- Re-commit all ψ★ states under WLv3 dual-hash  
- Reject all legacy single-hash commitments unless re-anchored  

**Identity remains intact** because it depends on ψ★, not SHA-256.

---

## 🟥 Scenario B: PQ Breaks Lattice Signatures

**Effect:**  
Dilithium / Falcon become unsafe.

**Response:**  
- SIG-WCT continues to function because it is *hash-based*  
- Re-anchor signatures under new hash families  
- PQ signature layer becomes optional  

**ψ★ identity unaffected.**

---

## 🟥 Scenario C: Adversarial AI Forgeries

**Attempted Attack:**  
AI generates fake ψ★ states.

**Defense:**  
- curvature invariants fail  
- PDE consistency fails  
- kernel-locked evolution fails  
- evolution history fails  

Under tested adversaries, forgeries have not been able to reproduce a valid PDE fixed point.  
This defense layer is independent of cryptography, but its strength is empirical.

---

## 🟥 Scenario D: Distributed Kernel Drift

**Cause:**  
GPU / CPU differences, FP nondeterminism.

**Defense:**  
- canonical float64 serialization  
- kernel version hashing  
- curvature tolerance windows  

Nodes must match evolution *bit-for-bit*,  
or the state is rejected.

---

# 7. Survivability Principles (Design Philosophy)

1. **Physics > Cryptography**  
   State irreversibility comes from PDE contraction.

2. **Identity = ψ★**  
   Cryptographic keys are wrappers.

3. **Curvature Is Law**  
   Every state must be curvature-bounded and physically realizable.

4. **Upgradeability Is Mandatory**  
   Hashes and signatures must evolve without breaking the system.

5. **Determinism = Trust**  
   All nodes recompute ψ★ the same way.

6. **Zero-Trust Verification**  
   No node assumes honesty.

7. **Minimal Assumptions**  
   The fewer cryptographic assumptions, the greater the survivability.

---

# 8. Long-Term Governance

WaveLock Tier-0 will adhere to:

- open-source kernels  
- public hash families  
- transparent version changes  
- deterministic PDE laws  
- global auditability  
- decentralized governance of safety parameters  

WaveLock cannot be proprietary  
and remain survivable.

---

# 9. Summary

Tier-0 survivability is guaranteed by:

- **PDE irreversibility**  
- **curvature budget**  
- **kernel-locked evolution**  
- **canonical WLv2 reproducibility**  
- **upgradeable cryptographic binding**  

WaveLock is designed to remain functional  
**even if specific cryptographic primitives are deprecated**,
by relying on physics-grounded identity (ψ★) and upgradeable hash bindings.
Full security guarantees depend on both the PDE's empirical non-invertibility
and the integrity of the binding hash families.

---

# 10. Next Steps (WLv3 Roadmap)

- Implement `HASH_FAMILY` enum  
- Build `hash_config` router  
- Add dual-hash commitment (SHA-256 + SHA3-256)  
- Define SIG-WCT spec  
- Publish WLv3 schemas  
- Add test suite for cryptographic failure scenarios  
- Fill out SURVIVABILITY.md as canonical reference
