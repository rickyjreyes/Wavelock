# Patent Notice

This software and its associated cryptographic curvature-signature architecture,
symbolic coherence mechanisms, and phase-evolving memory systems are protected
under a U.S. Provisional Patent Application.

**Title:**  
Coherence-Regulated Symbolic Graph Memory and Phase-Evolving Intelligence

**Inventor:**  
Richard James Reyes

**USPTO Filing:**  
U.S. Provisional Patent Application  
Filed: June 18, 2025  
Status: Patent Pending

**Summary:**  
The provisional application covers the foundational architecture for:
- coherence-regulated symbolic memory,
